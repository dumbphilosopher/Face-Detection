# Real-Time Face Detection

This project uses OpenCV and Haar Cascades to detect human faces in images and real-time video streams.

## Features
- Detects faces in static images (`image_detector.py`).
- Detects faces in real-time using a webcam (`video_detector.py`).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
